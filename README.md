Welcome to my experimented psychologist sign up project; I have created a interface for patent login, stored the results in a SQL php backend and coded most of the web pages utilizing html and css. I also incorporated JS to make the website more interactive and update in real time instead of jumping all over the place to different pages.

Everything is hosted in AWS although this project was done a little while ago and might not open anymore. 

Next steps I have ideas of incorporating Node JS to try and potentially consolidate the frontend and backend to the same backend; also need to fix sql injections potential problems and create parallel asynchronous processing.
